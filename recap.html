      <h2>Ruby Unconf 2023 Recap</h2>

    <section>
      <p>
        After a four year pandemic break, we were finally able to return to our trusty location, the campus of HAW
        Finkenau, for the third edition of the Ruby Unconf! Happy to see many newcomers and happy to spot many familiar
        faces who have returned for their second or even third time.

        In case you don't know how an unconference works, attendees pitch their own talk ideas in the morning, and then
        every attendee votes for their favorite proposals. Here are some attendees trying to decide which talk gets
        their voting stickers.

        After the voting, it was time for the only talk that was announced beforehand: Andreas Wenk gave a keynote on
        responsibility and sustainability in software development.

        For some talk highlights, Christian Bäuerlein presented on "the lost art of single file Ruby programs". Did you
        know an entire Rails app can be a single file?

        And Sergy Sergyenko, organizer of the 2023 Euruko, managed to give not one, but two talks! Here he is speaking
        about legacy vs revenant code. Sergy enjoyed the unconference format so much that he even brought it to the
        Euruko!

        Having the Unconf party at the Reeperbahn, Hamburg's most famous and street offering the most diverse range of
        entertainment, is a tradition by now. We had a great time at the Sommersalon!

        yoga session on the upper level outside.
