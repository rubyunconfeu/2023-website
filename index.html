        <h2>What exactly is an Unconference?</h2>

        It is an Barcamp style event. It works like this: Everybody can propose a talk.
        Everybody votes for the talks they want to see. The most voted talks will be held. You decide what will happen!
      </section>

      <section id="talk">
        <h2>Prepare a talk</h2>

        We recommend to prepare slides for your talk. The talk length will be half an hour. You get the chance to pitch
        your talk at the beginning of each conference day. Besides talks different formats like workshops or panel
        discussions are welcome.

      <section id="location">
        <h2>Location</h2>

        We're aiming to have the 2023 Ruby Unconf at the <a href="https://www.haw-hamburg.de/" target="_blank">HAW Hamburg Finkenau</a> again.
        (<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/directions?from=&to=53.56922%2C10.03495#map=19/53.56909/10.03470" target="_blank">Finkenau 35, 22081 Hamburg, Germany</a>)

        <h4>Hamburg</h4>

        Quoting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg">Wikipedia</a>:

        <blockquote>
          Hamburg, officially the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, is the second-largest city in Germany after Berlin
          and 8th largest city in the European Union with a population of over 1.8 million. 
        </blockquote>

        Getting to Hamburg is easy. By bike, train, car, plane - even by boat.
        The <a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Hamburg">Wikivoyage travel guide</a> sums up everything you need to
        know about getting to and getting around Hamburg, finding a place to stay or even moving here.

        or e-mail is also fine. On the conference itself we ask our participants if it's ok to have pictures taken with
        them. We won't publish pictures of people opting out of that. In case we accidentally did please leave us a note
        so we can remove the image.
